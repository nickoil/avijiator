# TODO — SH-101-a-like

Tracks actionable work against the plan in [architecture.md](architecture.md).
Tooling decision: **VS Code + CMake** for the Windows dev stage (no Projucer,
no Visual Studio IDE); **Projucer → Gradle**, built/run from VS Code's
terminal, for the Android port stage (Android Studio kept only as a debugger
fallback, not the daily driver).

## 0. Tooling setup

- [x] Install VS Code extensions: C/C++ (ms-vscode.cpptools), CMake Tools
- [x] Install Visual Studio Build Tools — "Desktop development with C++"
      workload only (headless compiler/linker/MSVC debugger engine, not the
      Visual Studio IDE)
- [x] Get JUCE source (submodule or CMake `FetchContent`) — used a git
      submodule pinned to tag `9.0.1` at `libs/JUCE`
- [x] Write root `CMakeLists.txt`: `juce_add_gui_app` standalone target,
      link required JUCE modules (audio basics, DSP, GUI) — configure-only
      check passes (VS 17 2022 generator); build/run/sound is Stage A item 1
- [x] Set static MSVC runtime linking (`/MT` instead of default `/MD`) via
      `MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY` target property — needed for true single-exe
      distribution with no Visual C++ Redistributable dependency on the
      target machine — verified in generated .vcxproj: MultiThreaded(Debug)
      for Debug, MultiThreaded (/MT) for Release/RelWithDebInfo/MinSizeRel
- [ ] Confirm CMake Tools can configure, build, run, and **debug**
      (breakpoint + step) a trivial JUCE app before writing real DSP

## 1. Stage A — Windows (dev)

Build/validate everything here before touching Android.

- [ ] **1. Environment check** — minimal JUCE Windows standalone app builds,
      runs, makes sound
- [ ] **2. Oscillator + filter core** — saw/square + sub + noise mix →
      resonant lowpass; A/B against reference SH-101 recordings
- [ ] **3. Envelope + LFO** — shared ADSR routing (filter/amp/both), LFO →
      pitch and/or filter cutoff
- [ ] **4. Mono note handling** — note-priority logic, glide/legato vs.
      retrigger; drive via USB MIDI keyboard or computer-keyboard input
- [ ] **5. Arpeggiator** — pattern modes (up/down/up-down/random/as-played),
      sample-accurate clock (not `Timer`-based), rate control
- [ ] **6. UI pass** — knobs/controls for what's built so far, mouse-driven;
      keep touch-first layout decisions in mind even though untested
- [ ] **7. Step sequencer (phase 2)** — 16-step (page-able) pattern, per-step
      pitch/gate/accent/slide, shared clock/trigger plumbing with the arp

## 2. Stage B — Android (port)

- [ ] Install Android SDK/NDK (standalone `cmdline-tools`/`sdkmanager` —
      Android Studio not required just for provisioning)
- [ ] Create a `.jucer` file mirroring the CMake project's module list and
      source files, for Projucer's Android exporter — **note**: this is a
      second project definition to keep in sync with `CMakeLists.txt`
      manually whenever files/modules change
- [ ] Run Projucer's Android exporter → generate the Gradle project
- [ ] **8. Port setup** — confirm the Stage A code builds, installs, and
      makes sound with acceptable latency on the Pixel via `gradlew`/`adb`
      from VS Code's terminal; configure AAudio low-latency (MMAP) path
      explicitly (not automatic)
- [ ] **9. Touch pass** — adapt UI from mouse to touch (tap-to-toggle steps,
      long-press/mode-toggle for accent/slide)
- [ ] **10. Field test** — full rig (phone + hub + interface + MIDI) under
      real playing conditions before relying on it at a gig

## 3. Hardware / live rig

- [ ] Prototype-phase audio out: Behringer UCA202 (cheap, class-compliant,
      sufficient for Stage A/B bring-up)
- [ ] Re-evaluate interface for the final rig at field-test time — balanced
      TRS out (UMC202HD) vs. sticking with the Focusrite Scarlett Solo
- [ ] Confirm hub is genuinely *powered*, not a passive splitter
- [ ] USB class-compliant MIDI keyboard (or Bluetooth MIDI, accepting
      latency/dropout trade-off)
- [ ] Test full power chain (phone + hub + interface + MIDI) under load —
      don't assume stability

## Open questions (carried from architecture.md)

- [ ] Filter topology: SVF cascade vs. ladder emulation — start SVF, revisit
      if it lacks character
- [ ] Note-priority scheme: last-note vs. highest-note — decide by ear
- [ ] Actual cost of the Windows→Android port once Stage A is done — UI
      input handling and audio backend are known rework points, not a
      recompile
